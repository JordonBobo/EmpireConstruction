### Description
This app was deployed and developed on the gh-pages branch of this repo. This app uses the Random user Generator Api (https://randomuser.me/) to generate a table of fictional employees. That page can then be filtered according to a fictional quality associated with the employees called "Loyalty to the Empire", as though you were looking for possible employees to work on a more secretive project. The names can be sorted at any time alphabetically or reverse alphabetically. This page was built using React.
